Write a polyphonic software synthesizer supporting instruments in c++ without any external dependencies that loads music files from the commandline. Additionally also include a sample song file for a Tjajkovskij

> Here is a sample C++ code for a polyphonic software synthesizer that supports instruments and loads music files from the commandline. The synthesizer does not have any external dependencies and is able to play a sample song file for Tjajkovskij's "Swan Lake".

> To play the sample song file for Tjajkovskij's "Swan Lake" using the synthesizer, the user can run the following command on the commandline:
>    ./synthesizer swan_lake.txt
