Write a polyphonic software synthesizer supporting instruments in c++ without any external dependencies that loads music files from the commandline. Additionally also include a sample song file for a Tjajkovskij

> Here is a sample C++ code for a polyphonic software synthesizer that supports instruments and loads music files from the commandline. The synthesizer does not have any external dependencies and is able to play a sample song file for Tjajkovskij's "Swan Lake".

> To play the sample song file for Tjajkovskij's "Swan Lake" using the synthesizer, the user can run the following command on the commandline:

Great. Now write a modern CMake project that builds it

write a readme.md file for this project

git commit message in one sentance describing the changes we just made

The synth from earlier isn't calling generateSample. I think it would be better instead of playing the song we should synth the song to wav file

> Yes, you are correct. In the original code, the function generateSample() is not being called. It would be better to modify the code to generate the samples for the synthesizer and write them to a wav file, instead of playing the song directly.

> git commit in one line describing what we have done

the program generated song.wav but it's silent, why?

> The program is generating samples for the synthesizer and writing them to the wav file, but the samples are not being generated correctly. This could be due to several reasons, such as incorrect parsing of the music file, incorrect calculation of the sample values, or incorrect writing of the wav file.

> To fix this issue, we need to carefully review the code and identify the source of the problem. We can also add more debug output to the code to help us understand what is happening at each step. For example, we can print the values of the variables used in the sample generation and the wav file writing, and compare them with the expected values. We can also add more test cases to the code and verify that the generated samples and wav files are correct for those cases. Once we find the source of the problem, we can fix it and try again until the program generates a correct and audible wav file.

adding test cases seems like a logical step. add some test cases, again not using any external dependencies 

> To add test cases to the code, we can create a new function called runTests() that contains the test cases and calls the functions of the synthesizer. This function should return true if all tests pass, and false otherwise.
> Here is an example of how the runTests() function could be implemented:
