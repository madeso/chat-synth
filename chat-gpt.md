Write a polyphonic software synthesizer supporting instruments in c++ without any external dependencies that loads music files from the commandline. Additionally also include a sample song file for a Tjajkovskij

> Here is a sample C++ code for a polyphonic software synthesizer that supports instruments and loads music files from the commandline. The synthesizer does not have any external dependencies and is able to play a sample song file for Tjajkovskij's "Swan Lake".

> To play the sample song file for Tjajkovskij's "Swan Lake" using the synthesizer, the user can run the following command on the commandline:

Great. Now write a modern CMake project that builds it

write a readme.md file for this project

The synth from earlier isn't calling generateSample. I think it would be better instead of playing the song we should synth the song to wav file

> Yes, you are correct. In the original code, the function generateSample() is not being called. It would be better to modify the code to generate the samples for the synthesizer and write them to a wav file, instead of playing the song directly.
